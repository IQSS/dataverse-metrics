# dataverse-metrics

## Introduction

dataverse-metrics aggregates metrics from Dataverse installations around the world and visualizes them on a web page. It makes use of the Dataverse [Metrics API][] that was added in Dataverse 4.9.

If you are looking for visualizations for a single installation of Dataverse, please see https://github.com/gdcc/dv-metrics

## Requirements

- Python 2 (deprecated) or Python 3
- Apache web server or similar
- a web browser

## Installation

### Put code into place

Change to the parent directory for where you will install dataverse-metrics. `/var/www/html` is the default "DocumentRoot" for Apache on CentOS (defined in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`) and is suggested as a place to install dataverse-metrics, but you are welcome to install it wherever you want and use any server you want.

    cd /var/www/html

Clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-metrics.git

Change to the directory you just created by cloning the repo:

    cd dataverse-metrics

### Configuration

Copy `config.json.sample` to `config.json` and edit the following values:

- `installations`: An array of Dataverse installation URLs.
- `api_response_cache_dir`: Fully qualified directory where JSON files representing API responses will be stored.
- `aggregate_output_dir`: Fully qualified directory where TSV output files of aggregated metrics will be stored.
- `num_months_to_process`: For monthly metrics, the number of months to go back in time to download metrics from each Dataverse installation.
- `month_filter_enabled`: If you have `num_months_to_process` set high (e.g. 36 months) the dates will disappear from the bottom of the bar charts. Changing this boolean to true will make only even months appear and with fewer bars the dates will be visible.
- `endpoints`: An array of Metrics API endpoints to process. Note that the two types are `single` (i.e. `datasets/bySubject`) and `monthly` (i.e. `downloads/toMonth`). (You will notice a third type called `monthly_itemized` in `config.json.sample` but it is not yet supported.)
- `blacklists`: Arrays of terms to blacklist. Only the `datasets/bySubject` endpoint can have a blacklist.
- `colors`: A single color for bar charts and a palette of colors for tree maps.
- `github_repos`: An array of GitHub repos such as `https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse`. A line will be added per repo about the number of contributors.

### Aggregating metrics

Now that your `config.json` file is ready, run the `metrics.py` script to create a TSV file for each of the `endpoints` and a `contributors.json` file for the `github_repos`, all of which will be placed in the `aggregate_output_dir` directory:

    python3 metrics.py

(Please note that if you don't have Python 3 installed, Python 2 should work fine too but Python 3 is highly recommended because Python 2 will not be maintained past January 1, 2020 according to https://pythonclock.org and [PEP 373][].)

### Viewing the visualizations

Using the instructions above, index.html has been placed at /var/www/html/dataverse-metrics/index.html and should be available on your Apache server at http://example.com/dataverse-metrics/index.html

### Adding additional installations

The list of Dataverse installations depends on `all-dataverse-installations.json` which can be updated with the following script as new installations are added to the [map][] produced by [dataverse-installations][]:

    ./update-all-installations-list.sh

### Updating Metrics

To update your metrics periodically, you'll want to queue up a shell script in some flavor of [cron][].

Here's an [example shell script](update_metrics.sh) to get you started.

On a Red Hat or CentOS system, you might drop a file like [update_metrics.cron](update_metrics.cron) into /etc/cron.d/ to update on a specified schedule.
